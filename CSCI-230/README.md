# CSCI-230

In this class we were learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and how it all works together.
Since this is Computer Science it was mostly Javascript and making the site functional.
So, it might not be the prettiest.

## Snake Project
Snake project was we had to create the Snake Game from scratch. My code can be refined but it works.
This project was fun to create and I was finished with it early so I kept adding features like a high score system and a death screen.


## Final Project
This project was built using Babylon.js and it took me forever to create.
We were suppose to make an immersive 3d work around a painting of our choice.
Personally, I chose the _Painting Wandering Above the Sea of Clouds_ by Casper David Friedrich created in 1818

I added a town and tons of places for the player to explore but it is also not completed at least to my liking.
There are several areas where the trees do not sit, rocks do not lay, nor foundation stands, but it is still done very well.
